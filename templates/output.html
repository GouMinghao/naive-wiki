The history of the relationship can be traced back to when the  first gained independence. The relationship between the two countries have been, until recent years, quite strong, complex, and even somewhat positive in various aspects. Both countries used to have an extremely extensive economic partnership, and the great amount of trade between the two countries necessitated for constructive political relations, but significant issues still exist. The relationship is of economic cooperation,  rivalry in the Pacific, and mutual suspicion over each other's intentions. Therefore, each nation has adopted a wary attitude regarding the other as a potential adversary but has meanwhile maintained an extremely strong economic partnership.<ref>Woon, C.Y., 2018.

By reviewing the popular and scholarly literature on Asia that appeared in the United States and by interviewing many American experts, Isaacs identified six stages of American attitudes toward China.<ref>Harold Isaacs, ''Scratches on Our Minds: American Images of China and India'' (1955) p 71.</ref> They were "respect" (18th century), "contempt" (1840-1905), "benevolence" (1905 to 1937), "admiration" (1937-1944); "disenchantment" (1944-1949), and "hostility" (after 1949). In 1990, historian  updated Isaac's model to include "reawakened curiosity" (1970â1974); "guileless fascination" (1974-1979), and "renewed skepticism" (1980s).<ref>Jonathan Spence ""Western Perceptions of China from the Late Sixteenth Century to the Present"" in </ref>

===Caleb Cushing mission===

<p>
After the 1842  at the end of the  in 1842, many Chinese ports were forced to open to foreign trade, which threatened American trade in the region. President  In 1843 appointed 
Massachusetts diplomat  as commissioner and . With the goal of impressing the Royal Chinese court, the Cushing mission suddenly appeared with four American warships, loaded with gifts that exalted scientific wonders including revolvers, telescopes, and an encyclopedia. His arrival at Macau in February 1844 created a local sensation, but the Chinese government was reluctant to designate another most favored nation. Cushing cleverly mixed the carrot and stick. He warned â against the backdrop of his warships â that not to receive an envoy was a national insult. He threatened to go directly to the Emperor â an unheard of procedure. The Emperor tried delay, but he finally sent an envoy to negotiate with Cushing, leading to the signing of the  in the village of Wanghia on July 3, 1844. In addition to most favored nation status, Cushing made sure that Americans received , which meant that legal cases involving Americans inside China would be tried by Western judges, not by Chinese judges. In the following years American trade with China grew rapidly, thanks to the high-speed clipper ships which carried relatively small amounts of high-value cargo, such as ginseng and silk. American Protestant missionaries also began to arrive.  The popular Chinese reaction was mostly hostile, but there was a favorable element that provided a base of support for American missionaries and businessmen. By 1850-64, China was emeshed in the Taiping rebellion which caused millions of lives, and foreign trade stagnated.<ref></ref><ref>Richard E.

===The Burlingame Treaty and the Chinese Exclusion Act===
</h2>
<p>
In 1868, the Qing government appointed  as their emissary to the United States. Burlingame toured the country to build support for equitable treatment for China and for Chinese emigrants. The 1868  embodied these principles. In 1871, the  brought the first of two groups of 120 Chinese boys to study in the United States. They were led by , the first Chinese man to graduate from an American university.
</p>
<p>
During the  and the construction of the , large numbers of Chinese emigrated to the U.S., spurring animosity from American citizens. After being forcibly driven from the mines, most Chinese settled in s in cities such as , taking up low-end wage labor, such as restaurant and cleaning work. With the post-Civil War economy in decline by the 1870s, anti-Chinese animosity became politicized by labor leader  and his , as well as by the California governor . Both blamed Chinese '''' for depressed wage levels.
</p>
<p>
In the first significant restriction on free immigration in U.S. history, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act on May 6, 1882, following revisions made in 1880 to the Burlingame Treaty. Those revisions allowed the United States to suspend , and Congress acted quickly to implement the suspension of Chinese immigration and exclude Chinese skilled and unskilled laborers from entering the country for ten years, under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. The ban was renewed a number of times, lasting for over 60 years.

===Searching for the China market===
The , founded in 1895 by industrialists J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie, sought to provide the American capital and management that would generate a rapid industrialization of China. It started building the Hankow-Canton Railroad, to link central and southern China. It only managed to finish 30 miles of line. Americans soon grew disillusioned, and sold out to a rival Belgian syndicate.<ref>William R. Braisted, "The United States and the American China Development Company," ''Far Eastern Quarterly'' 11 (1952): 147â65.</ref> On the whole, the American dream of getting rich by investing in China or selling to hundreds of millions of Chinese was almost always a failure. Standard Oil did succeed in selling kerosene to the China market, but few others made a profit.<ref>Paul A.

In 1899, a movement of Chinese nationalists calling themselves the Society of Right and Harmonious Fists started a violent revolt in China, referred to by Westerners as the , against foreign influence in trade, politics, religion, and technology. The  took place from November 1899 to September 7, 1901, during the final years of  rule in China under the .<ref>Robert A. Bickers, ''Robert A.

<p>
The uprising began as an , , peasant-based movement in northern China, in response to foreign westerners seizing land from locals, concession grabbing, and granting immunity to criminals who converted to Catholicism. The insurgents attacked foreigners, who were building railroads and violating , and , who were held responsible for the foreign domination of China. In June 1900, the Boxers entered , and ransacked the area around the Foreign Legations. On June 21, in response to the ,  declared war against all Western powers. Diplomats, foreign civilians, soldiers, and Chinese Christians were besieged during the  for 55 days. A coalition called the  comprising , , , , , ,  and the  rushed 20,000 troops to their rescue. The multinational forces were initially defeated by a Chinese Muslim army at the , but the second attempt in the  was successful due to internal rivalries among the Chinese forces.

With national attention focused on the Boxers, American Protestants made missions to China a high priority. They supported 500 missionaries in 1890, more than 2000 in 1914, and 8300 in 1920.  By 1927 they opened 16 American universities, six medical schools, and four theology schools, together with 265 middle schools and a large number of elementary schools. The number of converts was not large, but the educational influence was dramatic.<ref>Varg (1980) p 102.</ref>

Because the Second Sino-Japanese War was undeclared, however, Roosevelt denied that a state of war existed in China and proceeded to send aid to Chiang.

American public sympathy for the Chinese was aroused by reports from missionaries, novelists such as , and '''' of Japanese brutality in China, including reports surrounding the , also known as the 'Rape of Nanking'. Japanese-American relations were further soured by the  during the bombing of , in which a gunboat of the US Navy was accidentally sunk by Japanese aircraft.

He warned:
:any large-scale United States effort to assist the Chinese Government to oppose the Communists would most probably degenerate into a direct U.S. undertaking and responsibility, involving the commitment of sizable forces and resources over an indefinite period. Such a dissipation of U.S. resources would inevitably play into the hands of the Russians, or would provoke a reaction which would possibly, even probably, lead to another Spanish type of revolution or general hostilities....the cost of an all-out effort to see Communist forces resisted and destroyed in China...would clearly be out of all proportion to the results to be obtained.<ref>George Marshall testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 20 February 1948, in </ref>

The United States did not formally recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) for 30 years after its founding. Instead, the US maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China government on Taiwan, recognizing it as the sole legitimate government of .
</p>
<p>
However, the Taiwan-based Republic of China government did not trust the United States. An enemy of the Chiang family, , was removed from his position as governor of Taiwan by  and fled to America in 1953. ,  (ROC), suspected that the American CIA was engineering a coup with , an American-educated Chinese man who attended the , with the goal of making Taiwan an independent state.

In December 1950, the People's Republic seized all American assets and properties, totaling $196.8 million, after the US had frozen Chinese assets in America following the PRC's entry into the Korean War in November.<ref>Charles Ford Redick, "The Jurisprudence of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission: Chinese Claims."

Truman administration announced on January 5, 1950, that the United States would not become involved in any dispute about Taiwan Strait, and that he would not intervene in the event of an attack by the PRC,<ref></ref> but these plans were quickly undone when the  began on 25 June with the invasion of the US-backed Republic of Korea by the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea. A US-led international coalition of troops drove the North Korean forces from the South. In response to the Soviet-backed North Korean invasion of South Korea, the  was convened and passed , declaring war on North Korea unanimously. The resolution was adopted mainly because the Soviet Union, a , had been boycotting UN proceedings since January, in protest that the  and not the  held a permanent seat on the council.<ref></ref>

<p>
The American-led allied forces pushed the invading  back into North Korea, past the North-South border at the  and began to approach the  on the China-North Korea border. Chinese warnings for the UN forces to not venture too close to their border were ignored, and in November 1950, a massive Chinese counterattack was launched. The Chinese army struck in the west along the Chongchon River and completely overran several South Korean divisions, successfully landing a heavy blow to the flank of the remaining forces. The defeat of the  resulted in the longest retreat of any American military unit in history.<ref></ref> Both sides sustained heavy casualties before the allied forces were able to push Chinese forces back, near the original division. In late March 1951, after the Chinese army had moved large numbers of new forces near the Korean border, US bomb loading pits at  in  were made operational. On April 5, the US  released orders for immediate retaliatory attacks using s against Manchurian bases to prevent new Chinese troops from entering the battles or bombing attacks originating from those bases. On the same day, Truman gave his approval for transfer of nine Mark IV nuclear capsules "to the  , the designated carrier of the weapons," signing an order to use them against Chinese and Korean targets. Two years of continued fighting ended in a stalemate, until the  was signed on July 27, 1953. Since then, a  has become an important factor in US-China relations.

===Vietnam War===

<p>
The People's Republic of China provided resources and training to North Vietnam, and in the summer of 1962, Mao agreed to supply Hanoi with 90,000 rifles and guns free of charge. After the launch of the America's Operation "Rolling Thunder" in 1965, China sent anti-aircraft units and engineering battalions to North Vietnam to repair the damage caused by American bombing, rebuild roads and railroads, and perform other engineering work, freeing additional hundreds of thousands North Vietnamese army units for combat in American supported South Vietnam. The United States lost 58,159 troops in the Vietnam War.<ref>Xiaorong Han,  "Spoiled guests or dedicated patriots? The Chinese in North Vietnam, 1954â1978."

</p>
<p>
The Chinese presence in North Vietnam was well known to US officials, and can explain a number of factors surrounding American strategy in the conflict. In particular, President Johnson and Secretary of Defense  ruled out the possibility of a ground invasion of North Vietnam early on, for fear of repeating the Korean War but now with a thermonuclear-armed China. However, it is unclear exactly what Beijing's reaction to a US invasion of North Vietnam would have beenâMao Zedong reportedly told journalist  in 1965 that China had no intention of fighting to save the Hanoi regime and would not engage the US military unless it crossed into Chinese territory. On other occasions, Mao expressed confidence that the People's Liberation Army could take on the US again, much like it did in Korea. Whatever Chinese plans might have been, the Johnson Administration was unwilling to tempt fate and so US ground troops never crossed into North Vietnam.<ref>Kwan Ha Yim, ''China & the US, 1964-72'' (1975) pp 57-82.</ref><ref> Frank E.

The United States continued to work to prevent the PRC from taking China's seat in the  and encouraged its allies not to deal with the PRC. The United States placed an embargo on trading with the PRC, and encouraged allies to follow it. The  in 1964 and, as later declassified documents revealed, President  considered preemptive attacks to halt its nuclear program. He ultimately decided the measure carried too much risk and it was abandoned.
</p>
<p>
For most of the 22 years between 1949 and 1971, Sino-US relations were uniformly hostile, with Mao Zedong frequently referring to the United States as "the most dangerous imperialist power", and the U.S. frequently attacked by Chinese propaganda. President Kennedy believed that US policy towards China was "nonsensical", and he considered reestablishing diplomatic ties in his second term. However, Kennedy's assassination in late 1963, followed by the Vietnam War and Cultural Revolution, ended any possibility of normalized relations with Beijing for years.
</p>
<p>
Despite this official non-recognition, the United States and the People's Republic of China held 136 meetings at the ambassadorial level beginning in 1954 and continuing until 1970, first in  and in 1958â1970 in Warsaw.<ref>Steven M.

<p>
===Rapprochement===
The end of the 1960s brought a period of transformation. For China, when American president Johnson decided to wind down the Vietnam war in 1968, it gave China an impression that the US had no interest of expanding in Asia anymore while the USSR became a more serious threat as  to displace a communist government and might well interfere in China.<ref></ref>
</p>
<p>
This became an especially important concern for the People's Republic of China after the  of 1969. The PRC was diplomatically isolated and the leadership came to believe that improved relations with the United States would be a useful counterbalance to the Soviet threat. , the , was at the forefront of this effort with the committed backing of Chairman Mao Zedong. In 1969, the United States initiated measures to relax trade restrictions and other impediments to bilateral contact, to which China responded. However, this rapprochement process was stalled by the Vietnam War where China was supporting the enemies of the United States. Communication between Chinese and American leaders, however, was conducted through , <ref></ref> and  as intermediaries.
</p>
<p>
In the United States, academics such as  and  pointed to the need to deal realistically with the Beijing government, while organizations such as the  sponsored debates to promote public awareness. Many saw the specter of Communist China behind communist movements in , , and , but a growing number concluded that if the PRC would align with the US it would mean a major redistribution of global power against the Soviets. Mainland China's market of nearly one billion consumers appealed to American business. Senator , Chair of the , held a series of hearings on the matter.<ref>Goh, Evelyn, ''Constructing the US Rapprochement with China, 1961â1974: From 'Red Menace' to 'Tacit Ally' '', Cambridge University Press, 2005</ref>

Richard M. Nixon mentioned in his  that the two countries were entering an era of negotiation after an era of confrontation. Although Nixon during his 1960 presidential campaign had vociferously supported Chiang Kai-Shek, by the second half of the decade, he increasingly began to speak of there "being no reason to leave China angry and isolated". Nixon's election as president in 1968 was initially met with hostility by Beijingâan editorial in the ''People's Daily'' denounced him as "a chieftain whom the capitalist world had turned to out of desperation".<ref></ref> Nixon believed it was in the American national interest to forge a relationship with China, even though there were enormous differences between the two countries.<ref></ref>  He was assisted in this by his  . Domestic politics also entered into Nixon's thinking, as the boost from a successful courting of the PRC could help him in the . He also worried that one of the Democrats would preempt him and go to the PRC before he had the opportunity.
</p>
<p>
In 1971, an unexpectedly friendly encounter between the American and Chinese ping-pong athletes called  and  in Japan opened the way for a visit to China, which Chairman Mao personally approved.<ref></ref>  In April 1971, the athletes became the first Americans to officially visit China since the communist takeover. The smooth acceptance of this so-called "" gave confidence to both sides. In July 1971, Henry Kissinger feigned illness while on a trip to Pakistan and did not appear in public for a day. He was actually on a top-secret mission to Beijing to negotiate with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.
</p>
<p>
Kissinger and his aides did not receive a warm welcome in Beijing, and the hotel they stayed in was equipped with pamphlets excoriating US imperialism. However, the meeting with Zhou Enlai was productive, and the Chinese premier expressed his hope for improved Sino-US relations. He commented that the US had intentionally isolated China, not vice versa, and any initiative to restore diplomatic ties had to come from the American side. Zhou spoke of the late President Kennedy's plans to restore relations with China and told Kissinger "We are willing to wait as long as we need to. If these negotiations fail, in time another Kennedy or another Nixon will come along."<ref></ref>
</p>
<p>
On July 15, 1971, President  revealed the mission to the world and that he had accepted an invitation to visit the PRC.<ref>Magaret MacMillan, ''Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed The World'' (2008)</ref>
</p>
<p>
This announcement<ref></ref>  caused immediate shock around the world. In the United States, some hard-line anti-communists (most notably Arizona Senator ) denounced the decision, but most public opinion supported the move and Nixon saw the jump in the polls he had been hoping for. Since Nixon had sterling anti-communist credentials he was all but immune to being called "soft on communism." Nixon and his aides wanted to ensure that press coverage offered dramatic imagery.<ref>See  and  for recordings, documents, and interviews.</ref> Nixon was particularly eager for strong news coverage.

Within the PRC there was also opposition from left-wing elements. This effort was allegedly led by , head of the military, who died in a mysterious plane crash over  while trying to defect to the Soviet Union. His death silenced most internal dissent over the visit.
</p>
<p>
Internationally, reactions varied. In the communist world, the Soviets were very concerned that two major enemies seemed to have resolved their differences, and the new world alignment contributed significantly to the policy of ''''. Romania's president  praised the US initiative as a "move for world peace". Several communist regimes, including Cuba, Albania, and North Vietnam, accused China of "capitulationism to the imperialists". North Korea proclaimed that it was the reverse and that the US had been forced to capitulate to China, having failed to isolate it.
</p>
<p>
America's European  and  were pleased by the initiative, especially since many of them had already recognized the PRC. In , the reaction was far more mixed.  was annoyed that it had not been told of the announcement until fifteen minutes before it had been made, and feared that the Americans were abandoning them in favor of the PRC. A short time later, Japan also recognized the PRC and committed to substantial trade with the continental power.  and  were both concerned that peace between the United States and the PRC could mean an end to American support for them against their communist enemies. Throughout the period of rapprochement, both countries had to be regularly assured that they would not be abandoned.
</p>
<p>
From February 21 to February 28, 1972, President Nixon  to , , and . At the conclusion of his trip, the US and the PRC issued the , a statement of their respective foreign policy views. In the CommuniquÃ©, both nations pledged to work toward the full normalization of diplomatic relations. This did not lead to immediate recognition of the People's Republic of China but 'liaison offices' were established in Beijing and Washington.<ref name="Dunbabin 1996 258"></ref> The US acknowledged the PRC position that all Chinese on both sides of the  maintain that  and that Taiwan is part of China. The statement enabled the US and PRC to temporarily set aside the issue of Taiwan and open trade and communication. Also, the US and China both agreed to take action against 'any country' that is to establish 'hegemony' in the Asia-Pacific. On several issues, such as the ongoing conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and Israel, the US and China were unable to reach a common understanding.<ref name="Dunbabin 1996 258"/>
</p>
<p>
Most major anti-US propaganda disappeared in China after the Nixon visit; although there was still occasional criticism of US imperialism, the Soviet Union had definitively become China's arch-foe in the 1970s.
</p>
<p>
The rapprochement with the United States benefited the PRC immensely and greatly increased its security for the rest of the . It has been argued that the United States, on the other hand, saw fewer benefits than it had hoped for, inasmuch as China continued to back America's enemies in Hanoi and Pyongyang. Eventually, however, the PRC's suspicion of Vietnam's motives led to a break in Sino-Vietnamese cooperation and, upon the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1979, the . Both China and the United States backed combatants in  against Soviet and n-supported movements. The economic benefits of normalization were slow as it would take decades for American products to penetrate the vast Chinese market. While Nixon's China policy is regarded by many as the highlight of his presidency, others such as  have argued that it provided very little benefit to the United States.

In 1973 to 1978, such distinguished Americans as , , , and  served as chiefs of the USLO with the personal rank of ambassador. China made clear that it considered the Soviet Union its chief adversary, and urged the United States to be powerful, thereby distracting Moscow. Liaison officer George Bush concluded, "China keeps wanting us to be strong, wanting us to defend Europe, wanting us to increase our defense budgets, etc."<ref></ref> Bush concluded that American engagement was essential to support markets, allies, and stability in Asia and around the world.<ref></ref>
</p>
<p>
President  visited the PRC in 1975 and reaffirmed American interest in normalizing relations with Beijing. Shortly after taking office in 1977, President  again reaffirmed the goals of the Shanghai CommuniquÃ©. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Carter's National Security Advisor , and senior staff member of the National Security Council  encouraged Carter to seek full diplomatic and trade relations with China. Although Brzezinski sought to quickly establish a security relationship with Beijing to counter the Soviet Union, Carter sided with Vance in believing that such a deal would threaten existing U.S.-Soviet relations, including the  negotiations. Thus, the administration decided to cautiously pursue political normalization and not military relations.<ref></ref> Vance, Brzezinski, and Oksenberg traveled to Beijing in early 1978 to work with , then head of the liaison office, to lay the groundwork to do so. The United States and the People's Republic of China announced on December 15, 1978, that the two governments would establish diplomatic relations on January 1, 1979.
</p>

===Normalization===

<p>
In the , dated January 1, 1979, the United States transferred diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The US reiterated the Shanghai CommuniquÃ©'s acknowledgment of the Chinese position that there is only  and that Taiwan is a part of China; Beijing acknowledged that the American people would continue to carry on commercial, cultural, and other unofficial contacts with the people of Taiwan.<ref>Jim Mann, ''About face: A history of America's curious relationship with China, from Nixon to Clinton'' (1999).</ref>
</p>
<p>
Much like the Nixon visit to Beijing six years earlier, the formal establishment of Sino-US ties met with a mixed response from many countries. Taiwan, although fully expecting this step, nonetheless expressed disappointment at having not been consulted first. The reaction of the communist world was similar to 1972, with the Soviet Union and its allies in Eastern Europe mostly being noncommittal, Romania welcoming the move, and Cuba and Albania being strongly against it. North Korea issued a statement congratulating "our brotherly neighbors for ending long-hostile relations with the US".
</p>
<p>
Vice Premier 's  to Washington initiated a series of important, high-level exchanges which continued until the spring of 1989. This resulted in many bilateral agreements, especially in the fields of scientific, technological, and cultural interchange, as well as trade relations. Since early 1979, the United States and the PRC have initiated hundreds of joint research projects and cooperative programs under the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology, the largest bilateral program.<ref></ref>
</p>
<p>
On March 1, 1979, the two countries formally established embassies in each other's capitals. In 1979, outstanding private claims were resolved and a bilateral trade agreement was completed. Vice President Walter Mondale reciprocated Vice Premier Deng's visit with an August 1979 trip to China. This visit led to agreements in September 1980 on maritime affairs, civil aviation links, and textile matters, as well as a bilateral consular convention.
</p>
<p>
The threats of the  and  were major factors that brought Washington and Beijing closer than ever before.<ref name=shichor></ref> Sino-US military cooperation began in 1979; American arms sales to China were initiated, and in 1981 it was revealed that a joint Sino-US listening post had been operated in Xinjiang, near the Soviet border.
</p>
<p>
Chinese demands for advanced technology from the US were not always met, in part due to opposition from Congressmen who either distrusted technology transfer to a communist nation out of principle, or concern that there was no guarantee that such technology would not end up in the hands of unfriendly third parties. In 1983, the US State Department changed its classification of China to "a friendly, developing nation", thereby increasing the amount of technology and armaments that could be sold. The skepticism of some US Congressmen was not entirely unmerited as China during the 1980s continued to sell arms to  and other states that were openly hostile to American interests.

As a consequence of high-level and working-level contacts initiated in 1980, New York City and Beijing become sister cities, US dialogue with the PRC broadened to cover a wide range of issues, including global and regional strategic problems, political-military questions, including arms control, UN, and other multilateral organization affairs, and international narcotics matters.<ref>Michel Oksenberg, "Reconsiderations: A Decade of Sino-American Relations." ''Foreign Affairs'' 61.1 (1982): 190.</ref>

<p>
High-level exchanges continued to be a significant means for developing USâPRC relations in the 1980s. President  and Premier  made reciprocal visits in 1984. Reagan's visit to Beijing went well, however a speech he made criticizing the Soviet Union and praising capitalism, democracy, and freedom of religion was not aired on Chinese state TV. In July 1985, Chinese President  traveled to the United States, the first such visit by a PRC head of state. Vice President Bush visited the PRC in October 1985 and opened the US Consulate General in , the US's fourth consular post in the PRC. Further exchanges of cabinet-level officials occurred between 1985 and 1989, capped by President Bush's visit to Beijing in February 1989.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after being elected president in 1980, Ronald Reagan made a speech criticizing the PRC and welcoming restoration of ties with Taiwan. These remarks aroused initial panic in Beijing, but Reagan's advisers quickly apologized for his comments, and the president-elect soon retracted them.
</p>
<p>
Reagan's first two years in office saw some deterioration in Sino-US relations due to the president's vociferous anti-communism, as well as the inability of the two nations to come to a common understanding over the Korean standoff, the IsraelâPalestine conflict, or the Falkland War. In 1982, Deng Xiaoping, in a reiteration of Mao Zedong's "Three Worlds" theory, criticized both the US and Soviet Union for imperialism. In 1983, there were quarrels over a Chinese tennis player, Hu Na, who defected to the US, and over an incident where an Olympic parade float in New York City displayed the flag of Taiwan rather than the PRC's flag.

In the period before the , a growing number of cultural exchange activities gave the American and Chinese peoples broad exposure to each other's cultural, artistic, and educational achievements. Numerous mainland Chinese professional and official delegations visited the United States each month.

===Taiwan issue===
Since the renewal of Sino-American relations in early 1979, the Taiwan issue remained a major source of contention. After the announcement of the intention to establish diplomatic relations with Mainland China (PRC) on 15 December 1978, the Republic of China (Taiwan) immediately condemned the United States, leading to rampant protests in both Taiwan and in the US.<ref>Steven M. Goldstein, and Randall Schriver, "An Uncertain Relationship: The United States, Taiwan and the Taiwan Relations Act."

The expanding relationship that followed normalization was threatened in 1981 by PRC objections to the level of US arms sales to the Republic of China on Taiwan. Secretary of State  visited China in June 1981 in an effort to resolve Chinese concerns about America's unofficial relations with Taiwan. Vice President Bush visited the PRC in May 1982. Eight months of negotiations produced the US-PRC Joint CommuniquÃ© of August 17, 1982. In this third communiquÃ©, the US stated its intention to gradually reduce the level of arms sales to the Republic of China, and the PRC described as a fundamental policy their effort to strive for a peaceful resolution to the . China's Ambassador to Washington, in an interview with  in April 2018, is quoted as saying that Sino-American relations hinge largely upon the US-PRC Joint CommuniquÃ© signed between the two parties and where the USA had agreed not to challenge the PRC's sovereignty over the island of Taiwan, but to respect China's "anti-secession law," until such time that Taiwan will be reunified with the Mainland.<ref>, , 4 April 2018 (minutes: 16:22â20:13).</ref> When the Trump administration came to power, contention over the Taiwan issue intensified; President Trump became the first sitting US president since Jimmy Carter in 1979 to have any formal political or diplomatic contacts with Taiwan when he decided to receive a phone call from president Tsai Ing-Wen. Trump has expanded the duties of the US' ''de facto'' embassy in Taipei- American Institute in Taiwan - by adding more security personnel, and has overseen increasing non-diplomatic visits of Tsai Ing-Wen and Congressmen to each other's countries/regions. In addition, American warships have reportedly crossed the Taiwan strait and increased military drills with Taiwan, which mainland China views as a direct threat to its sovereignty. The Taiwanese government has also warned the Solomon Islands not to switch recognition to the PRC as part of a bid to preserve its shrinking number of allies worldwide.<ref name="cnn.com"></ref><ref name="cnn.com"/><ref name="asia.nikkei.com"></ref><ref name="asia.nikkei.com"/><ref></ref>

 argued in 2019 that:
:The U.S.-China relationship is confronting its most daunting challenge in the forty years since the two countries established diplomatic ties. Current trends portend steadily worsening relations over the long term, with increasingly adverse consequences for all actors involved. Specifically, Beijing and Washington are transitioning from a sometimes contentious yet mutually beneficial relationship to an increasingly antagonistic, mutually destructive set of interactions. The often positive and optimistic forces, interests, and beliefs that sustained bilateral ties for decades are giving way to undue pessimism, hostility, and a zero-sum mindset in almost every area of engagement.<ref>Michael D Swaine, </ref>

According to two experts on US-China relations,  at Oxford University and Senior Lecturer Amy King at Australian National University, the consensus of experts is that:
:The relationship began to deteriorate in the second decade of the 21st century, and that the Trump administration has accelerated the deterioration. Explanations...have ranged over a large number of factors, all of which have played some role. Some relate to changes in official personnel in both the United States and China, others to the shifts and relative power between the two countries after the global financial crisis of 2007â2008, and yet others to China's greater determination to reform global governance institutions and to play more of a global leadership role.<ref></ref>

The waiver for the PRC had been in effect since 1980. Every year between 1989 and 1999, legislation was introduced in Congress to disapprove the President's waiver. The legislation had sought to tie free trade with China to meeting certain  conditions that go beyond freedom of emigration. All such attempted legislation failed to pass. The requirement of an annual waiver was inconsistent with the rules of the , and for the PRC to join the WTO, Congressional action was needed to grant  (PNTR) to China.

</p>
<p>
Chinese dependency on the US dollar became prevalent after the purchase of shares of the United States debt during the Great Recession. Due to this purchase, the two nations share a deeply rooted economic relationship. US depends on China for holding their debt and, in turn, China cannot sell their debt without decreasing the value of the US dollar in which the Chinese depend on for economic development. As result, the two countries depend on each other for further economic development. The economic connection between China and the United States is a powerful factor in reducing conflict between the two nations.<ref>Russett, Bruce (2010).

The United States, along with independent analysts, remains convinced that the PRC conceals its real extent of its military spending.<ref> </ref><ref></ref> According to its government, China spent $45 billion on defense in 2007.<ref name="china.usc.edu"></ref> In contrast, the United States had a $623-billion budget for the military in 2008, $123 billion more than the combined military budgets of all other countries in the world.<ref></ref> Some very broad US estimates maintain that the PRC military spends between $85 billion and $125 billion. According to official figures, the PRC spent $123 million on defense per day in 2007. In comparison, the US spent $1.7 billion ($1,660 million) per day that year.<ref></ref>

Concerns over the Chinese military budget may come from US worries that the PRC is attempting to threaten its neighbors or to challenge the United States. Concerns have been raised that China is developing a large naval base near the South China Sea and has diverted resources from the  to the  and to air force and missile development.<ref></ref><ref name="china.usc.edu"/><ref> </ref>

Andrew Scobell wrote that under President Hu, objective civilian control and oversight of the PLA appears to be weakly applied.<ref></ref>
</p>
<p>
On October 27, 2009, US Defense Secretary  praised the steps China has taken to increase transparency of defense spending.<ref></ref> In June 2010, however, he said that the Chinese military was resisting efforts to improve military-to-military relations with the United States.<ref></ref> Gates also said that the United States would "assert freedom of navigation" in response to Chinese complaints about  deployments in international waters near China.<ref>Miles, Donna.

<p>
China and the United States have been described as engaging in a race of military technology. Expansion and development of new weapons by China has been seen as so threatening as to cause planning for the withdrawal of US forces from close proximity to China, the dispersal of US bases in the region, and the development of various new weapon systems. China is also developing capacity for attacking s and for .<ref></ref>

In 2012, it was reported that the United States would invite a team of senior Chinese logisticians to discuss the possibility of the first logistics co-operation agreement between the two countries.<ref>Miles, Donna.   ''American Forces Press Service'', 12 October 2012.</ref>
</p>
<p>
Professor James R. Holmes, a specialist on China at the , has said that China's investments towards a potential future conflict are closer to those of the United States than may first appear because the Chinese understate their spending, the internal price structures of the two countries are different, and the Chinese need to concentrate only on projecting military force a short distance from their own shores. The balance may shift to the advantage of the Chinese very quickly if they continue double-digit annual growth, and the US and their allies cut back.<ref></ref>

<p>
In line with , the idea that "wars tend to break out... when the upward trajectory of a rising power comes close to intersecting the downward trajectory of a declining power," some have argued that conflict between China, an emerging power, and the United States, the current superpower, is all but inevitable.<ref></ref>

In 2003, the United States declared that despite some positive momentum that year and greater signs that the People's Republic of China was willing to engage with the US and others on , there was still serious . China has acknowledged in principle the importance of protection of human rights and claimed to have taken steps to bring its own human rights practices into conformity with international norms. Among those steps are the signing of the  in October 1997, which was ratified in March 2001, and the signing of the  in October 1998, which has not yet been ratified. In 2002, China released a significant number of political and religious prisoners and agreed to interact with UN experts on torture, arbitrary detention, and religion. However, international human rights groups assert that there has been virtually no movement on those promises, with more people having been arrested for similar offences since then. Those groups maintain that China still has a long way to go in instituting the kind of fundamental systemic change that will protect the rights and liberties of all its citizens in Mainland China. The US State Department publishes an annual report on human rights around the world, which includes an evaluation of China's human rights record.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
</p>
<p>
In a decision that was criticized by human rights groups, the US State Department did not list China as one of the world's worst human rights violators .<ref name=NYT></ref> However, the assistant secretary of the State Department's   stated that China's overall human rights record in 2007 remained poor.<ref name=NYT/>
</p>
<p>
Since 1998, China has annually published a  detailing the human rights abuses by the United States<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> and since 2005 has also published a White Paper on its own political system and democratic progress.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

===Influence in Asia===
China's economic rise has led to some geo-political friction between the US and China in .<ref></ref> For example, in response to China's response to the  by North Korea, "Washington is moving to redefine its relationship with South Korea and Japan, potentially creating an anti-China bloc in  that officials say they don't want but may need."<ref>Pomfret, John.  '''', 6 December 2010.</ref> The Chinese government fears a conspiracy by the US to encircle it.<ref>.   '''', 12 April 2005</ref>
</p>
<p>
China and the US have recently led competing efforts to gain influence in Asian trade and development.  In 2015, China led the creation of the  with the goal of financing projects that would spur the development of the lower-tier Asian economies, thus facilitating improved economic ties across the region. It has been suggested that the United States considered the AIIB to be a challenge to the US-backed  and the  and saw the Chinese effort as an attempt to set the global economic agenda on terms that would be formulated by the Chinese government.<ref></ref> The Obama administration led an effort to enact the , a multilateral trade pact between a number of Pacific Rim countries, which excluded China. According to the , the agreement was designed to âpromote economic growth; support the creation and retention of jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in the signatories' countries; and promote transparency, good governance, and enhanced labor and environmental protections."<ref name="ustr100620152"></ref>  The deal was placed on hold after the US withdrew from the agreement on 23 January 2017.<ref name="bbc-exexutiveorder"></ref> The efforts are among the attempts by both the US and China to increase their influence over the Asia-Pacific by strengthening their economic ties within the region.
</p>
<p>
According to an article published in '''', Journal of Philosophy of International Law and Global Politics, there is a "new Sphere of Influence 2"<ref>
</ref> that is shaped mainly by China and the US. Even on social media, if Western, Japanese, and South Korean events and daily life are linked through ,  and American habits and customs are disconnected by the lack of sharing on social media. That strategy to avoid American influences from social networks is preserved by the Chinese government.

In response to increased American  against militants in 's border areas during the Obama administration, the PRC offered additional fighter jets to Pakistan.<ref>Donald, David.   ''AINonline'', 6 June 2011.</ref>
</p>
<p>
Countries in Southeast Asia have responded to Chinese claims for sea areas by seeking closer relations with the United States.<ref>Slavin, Erik.  ''Stars and Stripes'', 27 June 2011.</ref> American Defense Secretary  said that in spite of budget pressures, the United States would expand its influence in the region to counter China's military buildup.<ref>Entous, Adam.  ''Wall Street Journal'', 26 October 2011.</ref>
</p>
<p>
On 7 June 2013, Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the  in , argued in '''' that the United States and China must stop striving for trust but instead emphasize verification:<ref name="Diplomat Roy"></ref> "The argument that trust leads to peace is built on the premise that the suspicions between China and the U.S. are unfounded and would evaporate with more and deeper dialogue. Unfortunately, however, at least some of these suspicions are all too warranted."<ref name="Diplomat Roy" /> Whether  should govern regional affairs in Asia, whether China should be allowed to make expansive sovereignty claims, and what the future strategic roles of  and  should be are issues that Roy considers to be irreconcilable between China and the US<ref name="Diplomat Roy" /> and so strategic trust is not attainable. "The two countries should strive to manage their inevitable bilateral strategic tensions by reaching agreements where both see a benefit and where compliance is measurable... for these inherent rivals and potential adversaries, the emphasis belongs on 'verify,' not 'trust.'"<ref name="Diplomat Roy" />
</p>
<p>
In the context of US-China relations, a potential application of MAR would be the US pledging not to move its forces into North Korea in the event of a regime collapse, which could be followed by a commitment from China not to move its troops to the  in that event.

Before the hearing,  released an article that stated that China is embedding technology in microchips that are sent to America that collect data on American consumers.
