(dating to  300 BC) of Achilles during the Trojan War]]

In , '''Achilles''' ( ) or '''Achilleus''' (, ) was a hero of the , the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and is the central character of 's ''''. He was the son of the   and , king of .
</p>
<p>
Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince  outside the gates of . Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by , who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with ' unfinished epic '''', written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because, when his mother  dipped him in the river  as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term "" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The  is also named after him due to these legends. == Etymology ==

</p>
<p>
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of  ('''') "distress, pain, sorrow, grief"<ref>Scholia to the ''Iliad'', 1.1.</ref> and  ('''') "people, soldiers, nation", resulting in a proto-form ''*AkhÃ­-lÄuÌ¯os'' "he who has the people distressed" or "he whose people have distress".<ref></ref><ref name=Nagy></ref> The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of  '''' ("glory", usually in war). Furthermore, ''laÃ³s'' has been construed by , following , to mean "a corps of soldiers", a .<ref name=Nagy/> With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

Another etymology relates the name to a   ''<em>hâeá¸±-pá¹ds'' "sharp foot" which first gave an  ''</em>ÄkÌpediÃ³s'', evolving through time into ''<em>ÄkhpdeÃ³s'' and then ''</em>akhiddeÃºs''. The shift from ''-dd-'' to ''-ll-'' is then ascribed to the passing of the name into Greek via a  source. The first root part ''<em>hâeá¸±-'' "sharp, pointed" also gave Greek á¼ÎºÎ® (''aká¸'' "point, silence, healing"), á¼ÎºÎ¼Î® (''akmá¸'' "point, edge, zenith") and á½Î¾ÏÏ (''oxÃºs'' "sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever"), whereas á¼ÏÎ¿Ï stems from the root ''</em>hâegÊ°-'' "to be upset, afraid". The whole expression would be comparable to the  ''acupedius'' "swift of foot". Compare also the Latin word family of ''aciÄs'' "sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement", ''acus'' "needle, pin, bodkin", and ''acuÅ'' "to make pointed, sharpen, whet; to exercise; to arouse" (whence ''acute'').<ref>Cf. the Wiktionary entries  and .</ref> Some   of Achilles in the ''Iliad'' point to this "swift-footedness", namely ÏÎ¿Î´Î¬ÏÎºÎ·Ï Î´á¿Î¿Ï á¼ÏÎ¹Î»Î»Îµá½ºÏ (''podÃ¡rkÄs dÄ©os AchilleÃºs'' "swift-footed divine Achilles")<ref>''Iliad'' 1.121, 2.688.</ref> or, even more frequently, ÏÏÎ´Î±Ï á½ Îºá½ºÏ á¼ÏÎ¹Î»Î»ÎµÏÏ (''pÃ³das ÅkÃºs AchilleÃºs'' "quick-footed Achilles").<ref>E. g.

Achilles was the son of the   and of , the king of the .  and  had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until , the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by , goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.<ref>, ''Prometheus Bound'' 755â768; , ''Nemean'' 5.34â37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26â47; Pseudo-Apollodorus, '''' 3.13.5; '''' 2.15.</ref>

<p>
There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the '''' (4.760) Zeus' sister and wife  alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god , was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, '''' 3.13.5.</ref>

<p>
According to the '''', written by  in the 1st century AD, and to , when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river ; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel<ref>Statius, ''Achilleid'' 1.269; Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 107.</ref><ref></ref> (see , ). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier.

She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.<ref>, '''' 4.869â879.</ref>
</p>
<p>
None of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the  hero , son of , challenged Achilles by the river . He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood".
</p>
<p>
Also, in the fragmentary poems of the  in which one can find description of the hero's death (i.e. the '''', the '''' by  of Pyrrha, the '''' and '''' by ), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel; in the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his torso.

According to , the sixth book of the ''New History'' by  reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; but when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron.

This 'astragale' fell when Achilles was pursued by Apollo and it was thus that Achilles, fallen, was killed.

With Lycomedes' daughter , whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son,  (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet  that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewellery and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away. == In the Trojan War ==

</p>
<p>
Homer's ''Iliad'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath (Î¼á¿Î½Î¹Ï á¼ÏÎ¹Î»Î»Î­ÏÏ, ''mÃªnis AchillÃ©Ås'') is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
</p>
<p>
The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by , the commander of the  forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named  as his slave. Her father , a priest of , begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet  correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize , the daughter of , be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis),<ref>''Iliad'' 9.334â343.</ref> with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles  to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.
</p>
<p>
As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus,  declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends  and two other chieftains,  and , to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

The Trojans, led by , subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction,  leads the  into battle, wearing Achilles' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.
</p>
<p>
After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from , the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades  to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the , described in great detail in the poem.
</p>
<p>
Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god , who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by  and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before , in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, , persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that "my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw â such agonies you have caused me".<ref>"The Iliad", Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991: 22.346.</ref> Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour.<ref></ref>
</p>
<p>
At the onset of his duel with Hector, Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, Orion's dog (); a sign of evil. During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to , the evening/western star (), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until , the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).
</p>
<p>
With the assistance of the god  (Argeiphontes), Hector's father  goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of 's offspring). The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come. === Later epic accounts: fighting Penthesilea and Memnon ===
</p>
<p>
The '''' (7th century BC) and a work named '''', composed by  in the fourth century AD, relate further events from the . When , queen of the  and daughter of , arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later.<ref>, 3.11.15;  1.</ref> At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.<!--- Sources for this? "Achilles fought and killed the  ." -->
</p>
<p>
Following the death of Patroclus, Nestor's son  becomes Achilles' closest companion. When , son of the Dawn Goddess  and king of , slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise, until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.
</p>
<p>
Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad''s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the  '''', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century BC. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors. === Achilles and Patroclus ===

<p>
The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers.<ref name="Fox 2011"></ref><ref name="Martin 2012"></ref> Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the ''Iliad'' that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from  to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the . In Plato's ''Symposium'', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.<ref>, '''', ; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at ''Iliad'' 2.673â674.</ref> But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish  and ,<ref>, ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.</ref> and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship. === Death ===
</p>
<p>
The death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions.<ref>Abrantes 2016: c. 4.3.1</ref> In the oldest one, the ''Iliad'', and as predicted by  with his dying breath, the hero's death was brought about by  with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god  guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valour, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of , and funeral games were held. He was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of  at the mouth of the river .
</p>
<p>
Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, . Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.
</p>
<p>
In the ''Odyssey'', Agamemnon informs Achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his  at the  while they are receiving the dead  in Hades.<ref>''Odyssey'' 24.36â94.</ref> He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean.<ref></ref> Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.<ref>E. Hamilton (1969), ''Mythology''. New York: Penguin Books.</ref> Paris was later killed by  using the enormous bow of .
</p>
<p>
In Book 11 of Homer's '''', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.<ref>''Odyssey'' 11.467â564.</ref> This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.
</p>
<p>
According to some accounts, he had married  in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the  of &nbsp;â as Hera promised Thetis in ' '''' (3rd century BC). === Fate of Achilles' armour ===

<p>
Achilles' armour was the object of a feud between  and  (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men, decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to , the son of Achilles.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of , Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf.

The cult was still thriving in the third century AD, when dedicatory  from Olbia refer to an ''Achilles PontÃ¡rchÄs'' (Î Î¿Î½ÏÎ¬ÏÏÎ·Ï, roughly "lord of the Sea," or "of the "), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with  such as the local  Prostates,  Agoraeus,<ref name=Hedreen/> or .<ref>Quintus Smyrnaeus, 3.770â779.</ref>
</p>
<p>
(23â79 AD) in his '''' mentions a "port of the AchÃ¦i" and an "island of Achilles", famous for the tomb of that "man" (portus Achaeorum, insula Achillis, tumulo eius viri clara), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the ; furthermore, at 125&nbsp;s from this island, he places a peninsula "which stretches forth in the shape of a sword" obliquely, called ''Dromos Achilleos'' (á¼ÏÎ¹Î»Î»Î­ÏÏ Î´ÏÏÎ¼Î¿Ï, ''AchillÃ©Ås drÃ³mos'' "")<ref>Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.12.83 ().</ref> and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him.<ref name=Hedreen/> This last feature of Pliny's account is considered to be the iconic , called today ''Tendra'' (or ''Kosa Tendra'' and ''Kosa Djarilgatch''), situated between the mouth of the  and , but which is hardly 125&nbsp;s (c. 185&nbsp;km) away from the , as Pliny states. (To the "Race-course" he gives a length of 80&nbsp;miles, c.&nbsp;120&nbsp;km, whereas the spit measures c.&nbsp;70&nbsp;km today.)
</p>
<p>
In the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as ''Achillea'' and introduces two further names for it: ''Leuce'' or ''Macaron'' (from Greek  Î¼Î±ÎºÎ±Ïá¿¶Î½ "island of the blest"). The "present day" measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of ''Achillea'' or ''Leuce'' with today's Snake Island.<ref>Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.13.93 (): "Researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles from the Borysthenes, of 120 from , and of fifty from the island of . It is about ten miles in circumference." Though afterwards he speaks again of "the remaining islands in the Gulf of " which are "Cephalonesos, Rhosphodusa , and Macra".</ref> Pliny's contemporary  (c. 43 AD) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named ''Achillea'', situated between the  and the , adding to the geographical confusion.<ref>Pomponius Mela, ''De situ orbis'' 2.7.</ref> Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823 on Snake Island. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC   inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: "Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke." In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.<ref name=Hedreen/>
</p>
<p>
The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on ''Leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic '''' according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical ÎÎµÏÎºÎ· Îá¿ÏÎ¿Ï (''LeÃºkÄ NÃªsos'' "White Island").<ref>, ''Chrestomathia'' 2.</ref> Already in the fifth century BC,  had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a "bright island" (ÏÎ±ÎµÎ½Î½Î¬ Î½á¾¶ÏÎ¿Ï, ''phaennÃ¡ nÃ¢sos'') of the Black Sea,<ref>Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.49ff.; Arrian, '''' 21.</ref> while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite  together with other heroes such as his father  and .<ref>Pindar, ''Olympia'' 2.78ff.</ref> Well known is the connection of these mythological  (Î¼Î±ÎºÎ±Ïá¿¶Î½ Î½á¿ÏÎ¿Î¹, ''makÃ¡rÃ´n nÃªsoi'') or the Homeric  with the stream  which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it.<ref name=Hedreen/> Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by , speaking of "Achilles lord of Scythia"<ref>D. Page, ''Lyrica Graeca Selecta'', Oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.</ref> and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles' fight against the n prince , who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother  after his death.
</p>
<p>
The '''' (c. 130 AD) gives the following details:
</p>
<p>
The Greek geographer , who lived probably during the first century AD, wrote that the island was called ''Leuce'' "because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour".<ref>Dionysius Periegetes, ''Orbis descriptio'' 5.541, quoted in DensuÅianu 1913.</ref> Similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.<ref name=Hedreen/><ref>Arrian, '''' 21; Scholion to Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.79.</ref>  has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles' temple and his statue".<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.11.</ref> Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the c  sent a lord of  to be cured of a chest wound.<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.13.</ref>  attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 22.8.</ref>
</p>
<p>
A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. ,  and  reported on the existence of a town ''AchÃ­lleion'' (á¼ÏÎ¯Î»Î»ÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½), built by settlers from  in the sixth century BC, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the .<ref name=Troad/> Later attestations point to an ''AchÃ­lleion'' in  (according to ) and an ''AchÃ­lleios'' (á¼ÏÎ¯Î»Î»ÎµÎ¹Î¿Ï) in .<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.25.4.</ref>  recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of  and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called  (presumably from an older ''Achileii''), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.<ref name="DensuÅianu">Nicolae DensuÅianu: ''Dacia preistoricÄ''.

The   wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of  and eventual death when an arrow shot by  and guided by  punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.<ref>Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002, p. 22</ref> In Plato's ''Symposium'', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.<ref>Plato, ''Symposium'', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8</ref>

The philosopher  centred one of  on an imaginary footrace between "" , by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions. === Achilles in Roman and medieval literature ===
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.<ref name="Latacz 2010"/>  refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,<ref>''Aeneid'' 2.28, 1.30, 3.87.</ref> while  portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.<ref>''Odes'' 4.6.17â20.</ref> Other writers, such as , , and , represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career.
