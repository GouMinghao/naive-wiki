Sources disagree on how the nickname "Buffalo Soldiers" began. According to the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, the name originated with the  warriors in the winter of 1877, the actual Cheyenne translation being "Wild Buffalo". However, writer Walter Hill documented the account of , who founded the 10th Cavalry regiment, recalling an 1871 campaign against . Hill attributed the origin of the name to the Comanche, due to Grierson's assertions. The Apache used the same term ("We called them 'buffalo soldiers,' because they had curly, kinky hair ... like bisons") a claim supported by other sources.<ref>Lehmann, H., 1927, ''9 Years Among the Indians, 1870-1879'', Von Boeckmann-Jones Company, p. 121</ref><ref name="nickname2"></ref> <ref name="nickname"></ref> <ref name="nickname3"></ref> Another possible source could be from the  who gave them that name because of the bison coats they wore in winter.<ref>DVD cover of the 1960 Western film '''' (Issued in 2016 by the  Archive Collection.</ref> The term Buffalo Soldiers became a generic term for all black soldiers.<!--when? by whom?--> It is now used for U.S. Army units that trace their direct lineage back to any of the African-American regiments formed in 1866.

==Service==
During the Civil War, the U.S. government formed regiments known as the , composed of black soldiers and Native Americans. The USCT was disbanded in the fall of 1865. In 1867 the Regular Army was set at ten regiments of cavalry and 45 regiments of infantry. The Army was authorized to raise two regiments of black cavalry (the  and  and four regiments of black infantry (the , , , and , who were mostly drawn from USCT veterans. The first draft of the bill that the House Committee on Military Affairs sent to the full chamber on March 7, 1866 did not include a provision for regiments of black cavalry, however, this provision was added by Senator  prior to the bill's passing on July 28, 1866.<ref name="Schubert"></ref> In 1869 the Regular Army was kept at ten regiments of cavalry but cut to 25 regiments of Infantry, reducing the black complement to two regiments (the  and . The 38th and 41st were reorganized as the 25th, with headquarters in  in , in November 1869. The 39th and 40th were reorganized as the 24th, with headquarters at , Texas, in April 1869. The two black infantry regiments represented 10 percent of the size of all twenty-five infantry regiments. Similarly, the two black cavalry units represented 20 percent of the size of all ten cavalry regiments.<ref name="Schubert"/>

<p>
During the peacetime formation years (1865-1870), the black infantry and cavalry regiments were composed of black  commanded by white commissioned officers and black noncommissioned officers. These included the first commander of the 10th Cavalry , the first commander of the 9th Cavalry ,  recipient , . The first black commissioned officer to lead the Buffalo Soldiers and the first black graduate of , was  in 1877.

<p>
From 1866 to the early 1890s, these regiments served at a variety of posts in the  and the  regions. They participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned a distinguished record. Thirteen enlisted men and six officers from these four regiments earned the  during the Indian Wars. In addition to the military campaigns, the Buffalo Soldiers served a variety of roles along the frontier, from building roads to escorting the .  On April 17, 1875, regimental headquarters for the 10th Cavalry was transferred to , Texas. Companies actually arrived at Fort Concho in May 1873.

In total, 23 Buffalo Soldiers received the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars.<ref></ref>

===Johnson County War===
</h2>
<p>
A lesser known action was the 9th Cavalry's participation in the fabled Johnson County War, an 1892  in , , between small farmers and large, wealthy ranchers. It culminated in a lengthy shootout between local farmers, a band of hired killers, and a . The 6th Cavalry was ordered in by   to quell the violence and capture the band of hired killers. Soon afterward, however, the 9th Cavalry was specifically called on to replace the 6th. The 6th Cavalry was swaying under the local political and social pressures and was unable to keep the peace in the tense environment.
</p>
<p>
The Buffalo Soldiers responded within about two weeks from Nebraska, and moved the men to the rail town of , creating "" despite a hostile local population. One soldier was killed and two wounded in gun battles with locals. Nevertheless, the 9th Cavalry remained in Wyoming for nearly a year to quell tensions in the area.<ref>Fields, Elizabeth Arnett.

==Park rangers==
Another little-known contribution of the Buffalo Soldiers involved eight troops of the 9th Cavalry Regiment and one company of the 24th Infantry Regiment who served in California's  as some of the first  rangers. In 1899, Buffalo Soldiers from Company H, 24th Infantry Regiment briefly served in , , and General Grant () National Parks.<ref>Johnson, Shelton  . Park Histories: Sequoia NP (and Kings Canyon NP), National Park Service. Retrieved: 2007-05-18.</ref>
</p>
<p>
U.S. Army regiments had been serving in these national parks since 1891, but until 1899, the soldiers serving were white. Beginning in 1899, and continuing in 1903 and 1904, African American regiments served during the summer in the second- and third-oldest national parks in the United States (Sequoia and Yosemite). Because these soldiers served before the  was created (1916), they were "park rangers" before the term was coined.
</p>
<p>
A lasting legacy of the soldiers as park rangers is the  (popularly known as the  hat). Although not officially adopted by the Army until 1911, the distinctive hat crease, called a Montana peak, (or pinch) can be seen being worn by several of the Buffalo Soldiers in park photographs dating back to 1899. Soldiers serving in the SpanishâAmerican War began to recrease the Stetson hat with a Montana "pinch" to better shed water from the torrential tropical rains.  Many retained that distinctive crease upon their return to the U.S. The park photographs, in all likelihood, show Buffalo Soldiers who were veterans from that 1898 war.
</p>
<p>
One particular Buffalo Soldier stands out in history: , who served with Troop "I", 9th Cavalry Regiment in Sequoia National Park during the summer of 1903. Charles Young was the third African American to graduate from the . At the time of his death, he was the highest-ranking African American in the U.S. military. He made history in Sequoia National Park in 1903 by becoming Acting Military Superintendent of Sequoia and General Grant National Parks. Charles Young was also the first African American superintendent of a national park. During Young's tenure in the park, he named a  for . Recently, another giant sequoia in Giant Forest was named in Captain Young's honor. Some of Young's descendants were in attendance at the ceremony.<ref name="west"></ref>

In 1903, 9th Cavalrymen in Sequoia built the first trail to the top of , the highest mountain in the contiguous United States. They also built the first wagon road into Sequoia's , the most famous grove of giant sequoia trees in Sequoia National Park.

In 1904, 9th Cavalrymen in  built an  on the South Fork of the  in the southern section of the park. This arboretum had pathways and benches, and some plants were identified in both  and . Yosemite's arboretum is considered to be the first museum in the . The NPS cites a 1904 report, where Yosemite superintendent (Lt. Col.)  declared the arboretum "To provide a great museum of nature for the general public free of cost ..." Unfortunately, the forces of developers, miners, and greed cut the boundaries of Yosemite in 1905 and the arboretum was nearly destroyed.<ref></ref>

In the Sierra Nevada, the Buffalo Soldiers regularly endured long days in the saddle, slim rations, racism, and separation from family and friends. As military stewards, the African American cavalry and infantry regiments protected the national parks from illegal grazing, , timber thieves, and forest fires.

==West Point==
</h2>
<p>
On March 23, 1907, the  Detachment of Cavalry was changed to a "colored" unit. This had been a long time coming. It had been proposed in 1897 at the "Cavalry and Light Artillery School" at  that West Point cadets learn their riding skills from the black noncommissioned officers who were considered the best. The 100-man detachment from the 9th,<ref name="Buckley" /> and 10th<ref name="10thcav" ></ref> Cavalry served to teach future officers at West Point riding instruction, mounted drill, and tactics until 1947.<ref name="Buckley">, Random House; 1st edition (May 22, 2001).</ref>
</p>
<p>
The West Point "Escort of Honour" detachment of the 10th Cavalry was distinguished in 1931 by being the last regular army unit to be issued with the M1902 blue dress uniform for all ranks. This parade uniform had ceased to be worn by other regiments after 1917.<ref>Randy Steffen, page 72 "The Horse Soldier, Volume IV, 1917-1943", University of Oklahoma Press 1979</ref>

==Systemic prejudice==
The Buffalo Soldiers were often confronted with racial prejudice from other members of the U.S. Army. Civilians in the areas where the soldiers were stationed occasionally reacted to them with violence. Buffalo Soldiers were attacked during racial disturbances in , in 1899,<ref name="handbook-riogrande"></ref> , in 1906,<ref name="handbook-brownsville"></ref> and , in 1917.<ref name="handbook-houston"></ref><ref name="odmp"></ref>
</p>
<p>
During the Indian Wars from 1866 to 1891, 416 soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor. Although the Buffalo Soldiers comprised 12% of the U.S. Army infantry force and 20% of the cavalry force in this era, Buffalo Soldiers were awarded less than 4% of all Medals of Honor awarded. Other regiments during the era received a greater number of Medals of Honor but were not distinguished enough to see duty in Cuba for the SpanishâAmerican War. For example, the  with 84 Medals of Honor, were not assigned duty to fight in Cuba in 1898. Scholars have hypothesized that commanders were reticent to award behavior that they expected from soldiers, the bureaucracy impeded awards, and the posting of black soldiers to remote outposts reduced the visibility of black soldiers (the  participated in twenty-one campaigns and the  participated in nineteen campaigns during this era, compared to the 9th Cavalry's eight campaigns). Historian Thomas Philips counted 2,704 engagements with native tribes during this era, of which the four black regiments participated in 141 or about 4%.<ref></ref>

<h2>
==John J. Pershing==
</h2>
<p>
is a controversial figure regarding the Buffalo Soldiers. He served with the  from October 1895 to May 1897, starting as a  when he took command of a troop of the 10th in October 1895.<ref name=NPS><a href="http://www.nps.gov/pwso/honor/pershing.htm">http://www.nps.gov/pwso/honor/pershing.htm</a>  </ref>
</p>
<p>
In 1897, Pershing became an instructor at West Point, where he joined the tactical staff. West Point cadets upset over Pershing's disciplinary treatment and high standards took to calling him " Jack," because he had learned to have full respect for black soldiers while leading them.<ref name=NPS/> Later during the , where Pershing served with the 10th for six months in Cuba, the press softened the term to "Black Jack", which they continued to use in World War I.<ref name=Vandiver>Frank E.

"The Rough Riders" by Theodore Roosevelt. Page 172. Taylor Publishing, 1997.</ref>
</p>
<p>
At the start of the SpanishâAmerican War, First Lieutenant Pershing was offered a  rank and commissioned a major of volunteers on August 26, 1898. He fought with the 10th Cavalry (Buffalo Soldiers) on Kettle and s in Cuba and was cited for gallantry.<ref name=NPS/>
</p>
<p>
During , Pershing was the  (C-in-C) of the  (AEF) on the . While earlier a champion of the African-American soldier, at this time he did not defend their full participation on the battlefield, but bowed to the racist policies of  ,  , and the  with its "separate but equal" philosophy.<ref name=Vandiver/>
</p>
<p>
Baker was cognizant of the many problems of domestic and allied political involvement in military decision-making during wartime, and gave Pershing unmatched authority to run his command as he saw fit, but Pershing practiced  carefully where black participation was concerned, not engaging in issues that might distract or diminish his command. Even so, Pershing allowed American soldiers (African Americans) to be under the command of a foreign power for the first time in American history.

==The Punitive Expedition, U.S.âMexico border, and World War I==
</h2>
<p>
The outbreak of the  in 1910 against the long-time rule of President  initiated a decade-long period of high-intensity military conflict along the U.S.âMexico border as different political/military factions in Mexico fought for power. The access to arms and customs duties from Mexican communities along the U.S.âMexico boundary made border towns such as , , and , important strategic assets. As the various factions in Mexico vied for power, the U.S. Army, including the Buffalo Soldier units, was dispatched to the border to maintain security. The Buffalo Soldiers played a key role in U.S.âMexico relations as the maelstrom that followed the ousting of DÃ­az and the assassination of his successor  intensified.

By late 1915, the political faction led by  received diplomatic recognition from the U.S. government as the legitimate ruling force in Mexico. , who had previously courted U.S. recognition and thus felt betrayed, then attacked the rural community of Columbus, New Mexico, directly leading to further border tensions as U.S. President Woodrow Wilson unilaterally dispatched the Punitive Expedition into Chihuahua, Mexico, under General John Pershing to apprehend or kill Villa. The 9th and 10th regiments were deployed to Mexico along with the rest of Pershing's units. Although the manhunt against Villa was unsuccessful, small-scale confrontations in the communities of Parral and Carrizal nearly brought about a war between Mexico and the United States in the summer of 1916. Tensions cooled through diplomacy as the captured Buffalo Soldiers from Carrizal were released. Despite the public outrage over Villa's Columbus raid, Wilson and his cabinet felt that the U.S.'s attention ought to be centered on Germany and World War I, not the apprehension of the "Centauro del Norte". The Punitive Expedition exited Mexico in early 1917, just before the U.S. declaration of war against Germany in April 1917.

===Battle of Ambos Nogales===
</h2>
<p>
The 35th Infantry Regiment was stationed at Nogales, Arizona, on August 27, 1918, when at about 4:10&nbsp;p.m., a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a Mexican civilian attempted to pass through the border, back to Mexico, without being interrogated at the  house.  After the initial shooting, reinforcements from both sides rushed to the border. On the Mexican side, the majority of the belligerents were angry civilians upset with the killings of Mexican border crossers by the U.S. Army along the vaguely defined border between the two cities during the previous year (the  did not exist until ). For the Americans, the reinforcements were the 10th Cavalry, off-duty 35th Regiment soldiers, and militia. Hostilities quickly escalated, and several soldiers were killed, and others wounded on both sides, including the mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. PeÃ±aloza (killed when waving a white truce flag/handkerchief with his cane). A cease-fire was arranged later after the US forces took the heights south of Nogales, Arizona.<ref name=Finely></ref><ref name=Wharfield></ref><ref name=Clendenen></ref>
</p>
<p>
Due in part to the heightened hysteria caused by World War I, allegations surfaced that German agents fomented this violence and died fighting alongside the Mexican troops they led. U.S. newspaper reports in Nogales before the August 27, 1918, battle documented the departure of part of the Mexican garrison in Nogales, Sonora, to points south that August in an attempt to quell armed political rebels.<ref>General DeRosey C. Cabell, "Report on Recent Trouble at Nogales, 1 September 1918", Battle of Nogales 1918 Collection, Pimeria Alta Historical Society (Nogales, AZ). See also DeRosey C. Cabell, "Memorandum for the Adjutant General: Subject: Copy of Records to be Furnished to the Secretary of the Treasury. 30 September 1918", Battle of Nogales 1918 Collection, Pimeria Alta Historical Society (Nogales, AZ). Furthermore, an investigation by Army officials from , could not substantiate accusations of militant German agents in the Mexican border community and instead traced the origins of the violence to the abuse of Mexican border crossers in the year before the Battle of Ambos Nogales. The main result of this battle was the building of the first permanent border fence between the two cities of Nogales.</ref><ref>"Military Commanders Hold Final Conference Sunday", ''Nogales Evening Daily Herald'' (Nogales, AZ), September 2, 1918; Daniel Arreola, "La Cerca y Las Garitas de Ambos Nogales: A Postcard Landscape Exploration", ''Journal of the Southwest'', vol. 43 (Winter 2001), pp. 504-541. Though largely unheard of in the U.S. (and even within most of Mexico), the municipal leaders of Nogales, Sonora, successfully petitioned the Mexican Congress in 1961 to grant the Mexican border city the title of "Heroic City", leading to the community's official name, '''Heroica Nogales''', a distinction shared with other Mexican cities such as , and , communities that also saw military confrontation between Mexicans and U.S. military forces.</ref><ref>Carlos F.

Despite some official resistance and administrative barriers, Black airmen were trained and played a part in the air war in Europe, gaining a reputation for skill and bravery (see ). In early 1945, after the , American forces in Europe experienced a shortage of combat troops, so the embargo on using black soldiers in combat units was relaxed. The American Military History says:
<blockquote>Faced with a shortage of infantry replacements during the enemy's counteroffensive,  offered black soldiers in service units an opportunity to volunteer for duty with the infantry. More than 4,500 responded, many taking reductions in grade to meet specified requirements. The 6th Army Group formed these men into provisional companies, while the 12th Army Group employed them as an additional platoon in existing rifle companies. The excellent record established by these volunteers, particularly those serving as platoons, presaged major postwar changes in the traditional approach to employing Black troops.</blockquote>

The 2017 Netflix series  has a camp of former Buffalo Soldiers that have turned to farming (their fighting days behind them). In the series it is explained that the term "Buffalo Soldier" is derived from when John Randall held off 70 Indians with only a pistol, having killed 13 of them while he sustained multiple wounds. This explanation however is largely fictitious.<ref>The 13 Indians weren't killed by Randall, but rather by the soldiers coming to rescue him.
